      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I’m Ivan Ting, a freelance photographer who believes that creativity is sparked by curiosity.
        I find inspiration in quiet moments, wild ideas, and deep storytelling. From capturing candid photographs
        to crafting emotionally charged visuals—I turn ideas into experiences.
