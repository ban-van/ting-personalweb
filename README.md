Features Implemented:
1. Basic Navigation Functionality
   I kept the website simple and ensured that the navigation links work properly. One thing to note is that the Contacts link in the navigation bar doesn't lead anywhere if the user is on the Home, Gallery, or About Me page. However, if the user is on the Services page, clicking the Contacts link in the navigation bar will smoothly scroll down to reveal the contact information located within the Services section. This is because the contact details are not in a separate section but are embedded at the bottom of the Services page.

2. Gallery Hover Effects
   In the Gallery section, I added a simple hover effect to enhance user interaction. When a user hovers over an image, it slightly scales up and emits a soft glow, helping to make the photos more engaging and visually appealing.


Design Choices and Wireframe Deviations (with Justification)
1. About Me Section Layout
   I followed the original wireframe design for most of the layout. However, in the About Me section, I encountered a limitation. I wasn't able to alternate the position of the image and text (e.g., image on the left for one row, then image on the right for the next). When I attempted to reorder them, the layout became messy and unorganized. To maintain a clean structure, I chose to keep the image and text aligned in a single consistent format.
